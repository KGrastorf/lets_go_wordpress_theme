  <p class="about-copy">Hi there and thank you for considering Let’s Go Adventure Tours for you Tour and Transportation needs. <br /> </br/>

My name is Bryan Batchelder and I am originally from Haverhill, Massachusetts. After serving 4 years in the United States Marine Corp, i went to Bucks County Community College in Newtown, Pennsylvania and graduated with a Health and PE Degree. After further education at West Chester University I decided to move West in 1993 and my love affair began. That summer I drove tour buses in Glacier National Park for 6 Summers. I’ve worked in Ski Towns such as Steamboat Springs, Colorado and Whitefish, Montana. I was a Tour Guide on the McKinnley Explorer Train in Alaska. I have been a Ski Guide and a Raft Guide. I have crewed on  4 different boats on the Island of Maui and became a volunteer for the Hawaiian Island Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. I have driven many kinds of tour vehicles and people movers.
<br /> </br/>
 I have a real passion for College and Professional Sports but my true love lies with our National Parks and the living creatures within. It would be a great pleasure to have fun sharing my knowledge of Yellowstone National Park with you.
